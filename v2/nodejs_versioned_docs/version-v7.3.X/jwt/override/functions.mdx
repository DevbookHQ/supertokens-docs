## Main interface

```tsx
export interface RecipeInterface {
    /*
    * Called to create a signed JWT
    * 
    * @params: 
    *   - payload: (Optional) Object containing custom claims that shuld be included in the JWT payload
    *   - validitySeconds: (Optional) Time in seconds for which the JWT should be considered valid.
    *                      if this is undefined, the validity provided to the init function is used
    * 
    * @returns "OK" and the JWT if succesfull. "UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM_ERROR" if an unsupported signing algorithm is used
    */
    createJWT(input: {
        payload?: any;
        validitySeconds?: number;
    }): Promise<
        | {
              status: "OK";
              jwt: string;
          }
        | {
              status: "UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM_ERROR";
          }
    >;

    /*
    * Called to retrieve a list of JWKs that can be used for JWT verification
    * 
    * @returns "OK" and an array of keys (refer to JsonWebKey below for typedef)
    */
    getJWKS(): Promise<{
        status: "OK";
        keys: JsonWebKey[];
    }>;
}
```

## Supporting Types

```tsx
export type JsonWebKey = {
    kty: string;
    kid: string;
    n: string;
    e: string;
    alg: string;
    use: string;
};
