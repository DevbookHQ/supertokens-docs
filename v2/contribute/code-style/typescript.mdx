# TypeScript

- Use typed strings as much as possible. For example, if a `string` variable can have a certain values, do not assign it type `string`, but instead use `"val1" | "val2" ...`

- Use `type` instead of `interfaces` or `namespace`.

- Classes must start with a capital letter, but variables with a small letter.

- No `switch` statements, use `if, else` instead.

- Camel case is preferred over using underscores.

- Minimise use of old JS style coding:
   - use classes instead of prototypes
   - use arrow functions whenever possible (except for when implementing recipe / api interfaces. See https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/199)
   - no use of `var`, always use` let`

- Always use `===` and never `==`

- Always do explicit `if` checks. For example, if `var1: string | undefined`, do not do `if (var1)`, instead, do `if (var1 !== undefined)`. The only time something like `if(var2)` is acceptable, is when the type of `var2: boolean`.

- if the return type of a function is an object, then specify the object's type in the function signature. If the object is used in several places, create a `type` for it in a `types.ts` file, and reference that.

- If the return type of a function is an object that has a different structure based on the logic of the function, then use the `|` operator. For example, a return type can be:
   ```ts
   {status: "OK", name: string} | {status: "FAILED"} // good
   ```

   We prefer the above as opposed to 
   ```ts
   {status: "OK" | "FAILED", name?: string} // bad
   ```

   because the second option expresses more possible types that what is possible - `name` will always be `undefined` if `status: "FAILED"`.

   Also notice that we have a common field (`status`) across the different object types. This is necessary since if we don't have this, then the consumer of the return type would have a hard time knowing what the structure is.

- Minimise the use of `null`. By convention, we prefer `undefined` over `null`.

- Minimise the use of `any` and `unknown`. But if we must use these, we prefer using `any`.

- Whenever creating an exportable module (to the user), we must allow them to import like:
   - `import T from ".."` and then do `T.A()`
   - `import { A } from "..."` and then do `A()`

- We want to minimise the number of named types. Otherwise this can grow to a very long list, very quickly.

- Miscellaneous functions like `checkEmailFormat`, or `convertToBase64()` can go into a `utils.ts` class. No need to create separate files for them. 

- Use `@deprecated` to deprecate functions and classes. When using this, make sure to use it in all functions that use the deprecated function as well (if applicable). If a user facing function needs to be deprecated, make sure to check that that's happening by using the playground.
