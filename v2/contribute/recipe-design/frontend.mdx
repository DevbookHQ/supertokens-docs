# Frontend SDK
- 1) Should be as decoupled from other recipes as possible so that it can be reused.
- 2) Should be as minimal as possible.
- 3) All sub recipes being used should be allowed to be overrided by an instance provided in the constructor. This will allow super recipes to also use these sub recipes without creating multiple instances of those sub recipes. An example of this can be found [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/lib/ts/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword/recipe.tsx#L61).
- 4) Recipe interface should follow:
    - a) If a function has valid error states, those should be returned from the function like `{status: "OK", ...} | {status: "ERROR_1", ...} | {status: "ERROR_2", ...}`. That is, no throwing or errors unless it's a general error, or if the type system for that language allows you to clearly define error types (like in the case of Java).
    - b) The implementaiton should take care of calling the pre API hook as well as fire the event hook.
- 5) All components and styles in the recipe should be overridable
    - a) All `divs` etc that are styled, should have a `data-supertokens` and a `css` prop like so `<div data-supertokens="container" css={styles.container}>`.
- 6) Each component theme should have a globally unique name. The format should be {actualRecipeId}{Name of component}. For example `ThirdPartyEmailPasswordSignInButton`
- 7) Each theme component must be overridable (using the `withOverride` component).
- 8) When doing output parsing for an API call, only handle what we care about. If the user has manually added some other fields to response from the API, let them handle that.
- 9) There should be one file where all the functions exposed by this recipe are listed and documented. This file will be linked from the docs as API documentation.
   - a) For functions
   - b) For component override interface
   - c) For functions override interface
- 10) User interaction with a recipe should be isolated to that recipe, even if that recipe uses several other sub recipes. For example, if a user initialises recipeX (which uses recipeY and recipeZ underneath), the user should not have to do `recipeY.something` or `recipeZ.something`. Therefore, recipeX must re-export useful functions / components that are provided by recipeY and recipeZ.
- 11) When implementing Recipe interfaces, make sure that if a function uses another function in the interface, it will call the user's overrided verion of that function (if the user has overriden it). See https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/199
